        <h2>CS340 Group 83 Project</h2>
        <h4>By Quinn Hoffman and Martin Nguyen</h4>
        <p>Managing large groups of people can be a costly challenge for companies. 
            The Oregon State University football team has 99 players on its current roster, 
            34 coaches, 6 types of equipment with over 1188 pieces to be divided among the 
            players, and 13 injuries of varying severity. Therefore, we propose a 
            database-driven web application that management can use to keep track of Players,
            Coaches, Equipment, and Injuries. This system allows management to easily access 
            information on their players: who theyâ€™re coached by, what games they played, what
            equipment they have been assigned, and the injuries that they have. With this database,
            it will help streamline, keeping track of players and their equipment. It will be easier 
            to manage the roster of coaches and players, track down missing pieces of gear that can cost 
            hundreds of dollars, and show what injuries they have.</p>
